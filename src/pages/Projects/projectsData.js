    introParagraph: "We started working with Citadel Canine in October 2020, while their organization was severely suffering from COVID-19 ramifications.Their mission is to help public workers (firefighters, nurses, veterans, etc.) suffering from PTSD by providing them support dogs at no charge. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had drastic effects on their organization. They lost 70% of their team and were facing extreme lows in funds and donations. We helped them with many services, including a logo, website, marketing plan, social media posts, fundraising ideas, a calendar and more.",

They are a Non-Profit organization that offer full program of active learning for pre-school and school-aged children. We joined their mission to enhance their brand image and social media presence. Their website was outdated and in need of a face-lift. We designed the website and developed it in house with our team of developers. In addition, our marketing team worked on developing a calendar and strategies to enhance their social media presence. With these, we designed some posting templates to further improve their brand image.",
