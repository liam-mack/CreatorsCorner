    introParagraph: "We started working with Citadel Canine in October 2020, while their organization was severely suffering from COVID-19 ramifications.Their mission is to help public workers (firefighters, nurses, veterans, etc.) suffering from PTSD by providing them support dogs at no charge. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had drastic effects on their organization. They lost 70% of their team and were facing extreme lows in funds and donations. We helped them with many services, including a logo, website, marketing plan, social media posts, fundraising ideas, a calendar and more.",
    testimonial: "Creator's Corner was truly a gift to us. We had not even raised a fraction of the money we needed to operate, and we had a long to-do list that had no end in sight. Being able to work with CC gave us the power to focus on the important things and put our best foot forward in 2021.",

They are a Non-Profit organization that offer full program of active learning for pre-school and school-aged children. We joined their mission to enhance their brand image and social media presence. Their website was outdated and in need of a face-lift. We designed the website and developed it in house with our team of developers. In addition, our marketing team worked on developing a calendar and strategies to enhance their social media presence. With these, we designed some posting templates to further improve their brand image.",
